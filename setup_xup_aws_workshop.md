# Connecting to AWS

## Introduction

The following instructions are for attendees on a live instructor led workshop where an AWS F1 instance has been set up for you, and you have been provided with log-in details. If you are not attending a live workshop, go back to the [Setup SDx](./get_started) page and follow one of the other options to work through these labs.

This lab will guide you through the steps involved in connecting to an Xilinx workshop AWS EC2 F1 instance, and starting and stopping the instance.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Connect to an AWS EC2 F1 instance using the provided credentials
- Start an instance
- Start a RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) session
- Close the RDP session
- Stop the instance

## Steps
Each registered participant to Xilinx workshop has been allocated a pre-configured EC2 F1 instance and should have received an email with the following details:  

- Account ID, 
- IAM username, 
- Link to access a pre-configured EC2 F1 instance

### Login into the AWS and starting an F1 instance

* Follow the link provided by your instructor, or go to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) to open a login page  
  If you had used the link then you should see a login page similar to shown here:

<p align="center">

</p>
<p align = "center">
<i>Login page accessed through the provided link</i>
</p>  

* Use the log in details provided by your instructor. 

* In the top right corner, using the drop-down button, select a region with F1 instances, such as **N. Virginia (US East)** or the region indicated by your instructor

<i>Selecting a region</i>
</p>  
If you select the wrong region you may not see your instance.

* Click on the **EC2** link on the dashboard or if not visible, then click on the _Services_ drop-down button and then click on **EC2**

### Interacting with the Instance using RDP

**You can communicate with the instance using command line through PuTTY or Git Bash, and using GUI through remote desktop (RDP) connection.**

* Start a remote desktop session
* Enter the _IPv4_ address
* Click on the **Show Options**
    <p align="center">
    <img src ="./images/connecting_lab/FigConnectingLab-10.png"/>
    </p>
    <p align = "center">

    </p>  
* Right-click on the desktop and select **Open Terminal** to open a window
* You should enter the following commands in any newly opened terminal window to source the environments
   ```
      cd ~/aws-fpga	  
      source sdaccel_setup.sh	  
      source $XILINX_SDX/settings64.sh
   ```

### Stopping the Instance and Signing Out

**It is important to shut down the instance in order to stop billing meter.  You do not need to execute this command in this lab as you will continue the session for the subsequent labs**

* Type the following command to terminate the RDP session and shutdown the instance
   ```
      sudo shutdown now	  
   ```
* Check the browser window, you will see status as either **Stopping** or **Stopped.** Click on the refresh button to see the status update

## Appendix: Interacting with the Instance using Putty

* Start **PuTTY** or your preferred SSH client

* Enter _centos@&lt;public\_dns\_entry&gt;_ in the **Host Name** field and **22** in the _Port_ field  
Make sure that SSH is selected as the Connection type

    </p>  
  
* Expand **SSH** under the _Connection_ in the left panel and click **Auth**

* Click on the **Browseâ€¦** button, browse to where the private key has been stored  
  If you don&#39;t have the private key file (as in workshop) you can skip this step

* Click **Open**

    </p>  
    
* Click **Yes** 
The PuTTY window will open. It will ask for the password (in case of the workshop). Enter the provided password

    </p>  
  
* Set a password for the RDP connection with the following command

    ```
    sudo passwd <your choice of password> 
    ```

    You will use the same password in the RDP connection.

* Enter **exit** to close the session
